Learn Linux with guided step by step using a logical and systematic approach.

Understand the fundamentals concepts, commands, or jargons of the Linux operating system.









What is Linux?


Linux® is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system’s hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. 

The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work. Layer between hardware and applications. 

It is not a derivative of Unix, it was written from scratch.  

Birth 1991 ( Linus Tornvalds), First release - 1994, version 1.0



**How does Linux work?**


Think about an OS like a car engine. An engine can run on its own, but it becomes a functional car when it’s connected with a transmission, axles, and wheels. 

Without the engine running properly, the rest of the car won’t work.

Every Linux-based OS involves the Linux kernel—which manages hardware resources—and a set of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system. 

**Heart of the OS**: Kernal , core of the OS.

Organizations can also choose to run their Linux OS on a Linux server.

The OS includes some common core components, like the GNU tools, among others. These tools give the user a way to manage the resources provided by the kernel, install additional software, configure performance and security settings, and more. All of these tools bundled together make up the functional operating system. Because Linux is an open source OS, combinations of software can vary between Linux distributions.

 
 
The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:

_Bootloader_ –  The software that manages the boot process of your computer. For most users, this will simply be a splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away to boot into the operating system.

_Kernel_ – This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called ‘Linux’. The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.

_Init system_ – This is a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons. One of the most widely used init systems is systemd, which also happens to be one of the most controversial. It is the init system that manages the boot process, once the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader (i.e., GRUB or GRand Unified Bootloader).

_Daemons_ – These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop.

_Graphical server_ – This is the sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just X.

_Desktop environment_ – This is the piece that the users actually interact with. There are many desktop environments to choose from (GNOME, Cinnamon, Mate, Pantheon, Enlightenment, KDE, Xfce, etc.). Each desktop environment includes built-in applications (such as file managers, configuration tools, web browsers, and games).

_Applications_ – Desktop environments do not offer the full array of apps. Just like Windows and macOS, Linux offers thousands upon thousands of high-quality software titles that can be easily found and installed. Most modern Linux distributions (more on this below) include App Store-like tools that centralize and simplify application installation. For example, Ubuntu Linux has the Ubuntu Software Center (a rebrand of GNOME Software) which allows you to quickly search among the thousands of apps and install them from one centralized location.
