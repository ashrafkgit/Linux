It is Linux Kernel and collections of specific software's that together creates Operating System ( you can say it as - flavors of Linux) 

Microsoft Windows is an Operating System (OS), so is GNU/Linux, often incorrectly referred to as only Linux. Windows OS has versions (Windows 2000, XP,Vista, 7, 8, 10) but GNU/Linux OS has distributions which in turn have versions (typically a number). 

These distributions (or distros) are a source of confusion for Windows users.
