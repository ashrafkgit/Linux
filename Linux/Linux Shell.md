## Linux Shell
##



The shell can be defined as a command interpreter within an operating system like Linux/GNU or Unix. It is a program that runs other programs. The shell facilitates every user of the computer as an interface to the Unix/GNU Linux system. Hence, the user can execute different tools/utilities or commands with a few input data.

It is command line interface ( default interface) of the Linux. 
Shell accepts and executes certain commands.

Server Distributions - do not include GUIs 

Desktop Distributions - includes both the CLIs and GUIs

## What Is Shell Prompt?
A shell prompt is a special character or symbol that appears on the command line of a shell, indicating that the shell is ready to accept input from the user. The prompt has an interactive interface and typically consists of a user identifier and the name of the current working directory, followed by a command line special character or symbol, such as a dollar sign ($), the hash symbol (#), or the percent sign (%). The syntax is similar to other programming languages & it provides a visual indication of the shell's status to help users navigate the file system and execute commands efficiently.

_Functions_

> Control flow: if, else, then, shell loops, case, etc.

> Shell commands: touch, pwd, echo, ls, cd, etc.

> Shell keywords: break, if, else, etc.

_Prompt Indicators_

> Shell Prompt with $ sign - normal user account

> Shell Prompt with # sign - super user account ( for administration) 

> ~ Tilde sign - represents home directory



## There are various types of shells which are discussed as follows:

**Bash Shell**
In the bash shell, bash means Bourne Again Shell. It is a default shell over several distributions of Linux today. It is a sh-compatible shell. It could be installed over Windows OS. It facilitates practical improvements on sh for interactive and programming use which contains:

> Job Control

> Command-line editing

> Shell Aliases and Functions

> Unlimited size command history

> Integer arithmetic in a base from 2-64

**Csh/Tcsh Shell**
Tcsh is an upgraded C shell. This shell can be used as a shell script command processor and interactive login shell.
Tcsh shell includes the following characteristics:

> C like syntax

> Filename completion and programmable word

> Command-line editor

> Job control

> Spelling correction

**Ksh Shell**
Ksh means for Korn shell. It was developed and designed by David G. Korn. Ksh shell is a high-level, powerful, and complete programming language and it is a reciprocal command language as well just like various other GNU/Unix Linux shells. The usage and syntax of the C shell are very same as the C programming language.


**Zsh Shell**
Zsh shell is developed to be reciprocal and it combines various aspects of other GNU/Unix Linux shells like ksh, tcsh, and bash. Also, the POSIX shell standard specifications were based on the Korn shell.
Also, it is a strong scripting language like other available shells. Some of its unique features are listed as follows:

> Startup files

> Filename generation

> Login/Logout watching

> Concept index

> Closing comments

> Variable index

> Key index

> Function index and various others that we could find out within the man pages.

All these shells do a similar job but take different commands and facilitate distinct built-in functions.


**Fish**
Fish stands for "friendly interactive shell". It was produced in 2005. Fish shell was developed to be fully user-friendly and interactive just like other shells. It contains some good features which are mentioned below:

> Web-based configuration

> Man page completions

> Auto-suggestions

> Support for term256 terminal automation

> Completely scripted with clean scripts
